The focus of the project is to create a working prototype of an indoor air quality monitor to detect various volatile organic compounds (VOCs), Nitrogen Oxides (NOx), and concentration of particulates in the environment. Air contaminants can pose serious health risks if left undetected and unmitigated. In some cases, prolonged exposure to certain concentrations could be fatal. The adverse effects of high exposure to VOCs and PM vary for short-term and long-term exposure, and depend on the contaminants present. Symptoms that can arise from short-term exposure include eye, nose, and throat irritation, headaches, nausea and vomiting, dizziness, and worsening of pre-existing conditions such as asthma and other lung conditions.[1] While long-term exposure spanning from a few years to a life-time can have dire health implications that can lead to critical illness such as stroke, heart disease, and even cancer.[2]

Indoor VOCs and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) are produced by common household activities and products. Typically they are generated from sources such as smoking, cooking, and cleaning and are released into the air by consumer products such as cleaning solutions, solvents, paint, carpet and upholstery.[3,4] Because of this, VOCs and PM are ubiquitous and albeit impossible to entirely eliminate, it is vital to maintain levels as minimal as possible. Health Canadaâ€™s Residential Indoor Air Quality Guidelines present the recommended exposure limits of indoor air contaminants under which adverse health effects are unlikely to occur, and recommends that at a minimum, indoor PM levels must be lower than those of the residential outdoors. For homes with a ratio of indoor to outdoor PM levels greater than 1, Health Canada emphasizes the importance of implementing suggested solutions such as ventilation and air filtration.[3]

This highlights the importance of regularly monitoring indoor air quality to know when it is necessary to employ ventilation and air filtration systems indoors. The purpose of the indoor air quality monitor is to detect the present VOCs and PM in the air. Once certain levels are detected, it is designed to turn on the ventilation and air filtration systems in the home to maintain levels within Health Canada standards.
